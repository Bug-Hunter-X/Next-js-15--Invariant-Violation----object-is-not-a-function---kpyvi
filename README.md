# Next.js 15: Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 where an \"Invariant Violation: object is not a function\" error is thrown when a page component doesn't return a valid JSX element.  This often happens due to a missing or incorrect return statement within a component.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` file contains a page component that's missing a `return` statement. This omission causes Next.js to throw the error because it expects a JSX element to render. 

## Solution

The `pages/about.js` file (in the solution branch) includes a proper return statement that resolves the error. Adding a `return` statement will resolve this error. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You will encounter the error.

## How to Fix

1. Ensure each page component within the `pages` directory returns a valid JSX element.
2. Add a `return` statement with appropriate JSX if one is missing.

This repository serves as a simple demonstration and resource for resolving a common Next.js 15 error.
